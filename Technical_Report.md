Technical Report: Conversation Analysis Tool
1. Implementation Recommendations (Profanity & Compliance)
This section compares the two implemented approaches—Pattern Matching (Regex) and Machine Learning (LLM)—for detecting profanity and compliance violations in call transcripts.

Profanity Detection
Pattern Matching (Regex) Approach:

Accuracy: High for exact matches but misses context, slang, or misspelled words. Prone to false positives (e.g., "hell" in "hello").

Speed: Extremely fast. Processing is nearly instantaneous.

Cost: Free. No external services are required.

Maintenance: Requires manual and continuous updating of the profanity wordlist to stay current.

Machine Learning (LLM) Approach:

Accuracy: Very high. Understands context, nuance, and intent. Can differentiate between accidental and intentional profanity.

Speed: Slower due to the network latency of the API call.

Cost: Incurs costs based on the number of API calls and tokens processed.

Maintenance: Requires minimal maintenance, as the model's knowledge is managed by the provider (OpenRouter).

Recommendation for Profanity Detection:
For simple, high-volume profanity flagging where speed and cost are critical, the Regex approach is sufficient. However, for applications requiring higher accuracy and a deeper understanding of context to avoid false positives (e.g., for agent performance reviews), the LLM approach is superior.

Privacy and Compliance Violation
Pattern Matching (Regex) Approach:

Accuracy: Moderately reliable but brittle. It can fail if the conversation deviates slightly from the expected script (e.g., if an agent says "the amount you owe" instead of "the balance is").

Speed: Very fast.

Cost: Free.

Maintenance: Requires developers to constantly add new keywords and patterns as agent scripts or customer phrasing changes.

Machine Learning (LLM) Approach:

Accuracy: Extremely high. The LLM excels at understanding the sequence of events and the semantic meaning of the conversation, making it highly effective at identifying if disclosure happened before verification.

Speed: Slower due to the API call.

Cost: Incurs API costs.

Maintenance: Highly adaptable. It does not need to be updated for minor changes in wording.

Recommendation for Compliance Violation:
The LLM approach is strongly recommended for compliance violation detection. The task is highly nuanced and depends on the conversational flow, which is a significant weakness of the rigid, pattern-based Regex approach. The risk of missing a compliance breach far outweighs the benefits of the Regex method's speed and lower cost.

2. Visualization Analysis (Call Quality Metrics)
The application visualizes two key call quality metrics: Silence Percentage and Overtalk Percentage.

Silence Percentage: The gauge chart for silence helps identify calls with potential issues. A high silence percentage might indicate that the agent put the customer on hold for too long, that there were technical issues with the line, or that the customer was unresponsive. This metric is a useful flag for calls that may require manual review for poor customer experience.

Overtalk Percentage: The gauge chart for overtalk measures the amount of simultaneous speech. A high overtalk percentage is a strong indicator of a contentious or difficult conversation. It often means the agent and borrower were interrupting each other, which can signal customer frustration or an agent who is not actively listening. This metric is valuable for identifying calls that could benefit from de-escalation training for agents.

Together, these visualizations provide a quick, at-a-glance summary of a call's dynamics, allowing supervisors to efficiently identify problematic conversations without listening to every single call.
